# Welcome to SIT-FUSE

**SIT-FUSE** (Segmentation, Instance Tracking, and data Fusion Using multi-SEnsor imagery) is a cutting-edge self-supervised machine learning framework designed for automated object detection and tracking in multi-sensor earth observation imagery.

## What is SIT-FUSE?

SIT-FUSE addresses the critical challenge of analyzing complex environmental data from multiple satellite and suborbital missions with minimal human intervention. By creating a comprehensive "sensor web," the framework integrates observations from instruments with varying spatial and spectral resolutions to enable robust environmental monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Self-supervised learning** - Minimal manual annotation required
- **Multi-sensor integration** - Works across different satellite missions
- **Cross-instrument tracking** - Advanced contrastive learning techniques
- **Environmental monitoring** - Real-world applications in climate science
- **Scalable processing** - Handles both image-like and non-image data

## Applications

SIT-FUSE is actively used for:

- 🔥 **Wildfire and smoke plume detection**
- 🌊 **Harmful algal bloom identification**
- 🌴 **Palm oil farm mapping**
- 💨 **Dust and volcanic ash plume tracking**
- 🏞️ **Inland water body analysis**
